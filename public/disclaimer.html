            <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 28, 2024</p>

            <h2>Educational Purpose Only</h2>
            <p>
                OhmLab is designed and maintained as an educational tool for students learning about
                physics, electronics, and electrical circuits. All calculators, information, and resources
                provided on this website are intended for educational and informational purposes only.
            </p>
            <p>
                This includes all resistance calculators, resistor color code tools, series and parallel
                resistance calculators, and voltage divider explanations found across the site.
            </p>

            <h2>Resistor History & Fun Facts</h2>
            <p>
                Resistors were essential long before modern electronics, helping early engineers control
                current in telegraph and telephone systems. Fun fact: wire-wound resistors were once used
                as both electrical components and heat sources because they could handle large power levels.
                Whether old or new, resistors still serve the same safety role—protecting circuits by
                limiting current and dissipating energy as heat.
            </p>

            <h2>Accuracy and Reliability</h2>
            <p>
                While we make every effort to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our calculators and
                the information provided:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We strive for accuracy but cannot guarantee 100% error-free calculations</li>
                <li>All formulas are based on standard electrical engineering principles</li>
                <li>Results should be verified before use in critical applications</li>
                <li>Calculator results are approximations and may not account for all real-world factors</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>No Professional Advice</h2>
            <p>
                The information and calculators on OhmLab do not constitute professional electrical engineering
                advice. For professional projects, safety-critical applications, or commercial use:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consult with qualified electrical engineers or professionals</li>
                <li>Verify all calculations independently</li>
                <li>Follow applicable safety standards and regulations</li>
                <li>Use appropriate professional-grade tools and equipment</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, OhmLab and its creator, Ajmal Ali A:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accept no liability for any direct or indirect damages resulting from use of this website</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                When working with electrical circuits and components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always follow proper safety procedures and guidelines</li>
                <li>Use appropriate safety equipment and tools</li>
                <li>Electricity can be dangerous - if you're unsure, seek professional help</li>
                <li>Never work on live circuits without proper training and precautions</li>
                <li>Be aware of voltage and current ratings of all components</li>
                <li>Consider factors like power dissipation, heat generation, and component ratings</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real-World Factors</h2>
            <p>
                Our calculators use idealized formulas. In real-world applications, many factors can affect
                actual results:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Component tolerances (resistors typically have ±5% to ±20% tolerance)</li>
                <li>Temperature effects on resistance values</li>
                <li>Load impedance in voltage dividers</li>
                <li>Wire resistance in series circuits</li>
                <li>Parasitic capacitance and inductance</li>
                <li>Power ratings and heat dissipation</li>
                <li>Frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits</li>
            </ul>
