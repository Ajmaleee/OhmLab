            <h2>Goals & Future of OhmLab</h2>
            <p>
                The long-term goal is to make OhmLab a trusted electronics learning space with practical
                calculators, reference guides, and interactive examples. Upcoming improvements will focus
                on expanded circuit topics, smarter explanations, and more tools for students and educators.
            </p>
            <p>
                Future aspects include improved mobile guidance, printable study notes, and additional
                circuit calculators like power, current, and LED resistor sizing to support real-world
                builds and classroom learning.

            <h2>Resistor History, How They Work & Ohm's Law</h2>
            <p>
                Resistors began as simple wire coils and carbon compositions used to tame current in early
                radio and telegraph equipment. Today they come as precise metal-film parts or tiny surface
                mount chips that fit on a fingernail. A resistor works by converting electrical energy into
                heat, limiting current and creating predictable voltage drops. Ohm's Law explains this
                relationship: V = I × R, linking voltage, current, and resistance in every circuit. Fun fact: the first widely
                adopted resistor color code standard was introduced in the 1920s to help technicians read
                values quickly without printing tiny numbers. That same color band system still appears on
                many through-hole resistors today.
