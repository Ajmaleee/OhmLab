            <h1>About OhmLab</h1>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                OhmLab was created with a simple mission: to help physics and electronics students understand
                resistance concepts clearly and accurately. We believe that learning should be accessible,
                straightforward, and supported by reliable tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a resistance calculation tool, OhmLab focuses on core topics like resistor color code
                decoding, series and parallel resistance, and voltage divider analysis. These fundamentals
                build confidence in Ohm's law, circuit design, and practical electronics.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <p>
                We provide a suite of free calculators designed specifically for students learning about
                electrical circuits and resistance. Our tools include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resistor Color Code Calculator</strong> - Decode 4-band and 5-band resistor values</li>
                <li><strong>Series Resistance Calculator</strong> - Calculate total resistance in series circuits</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel Resistance Calculator</strong> - Find equivalent resistance in parallel circuits</li>
                <li><strong>Voltage Divider Calculator</strong> - Determine output voltages in divider circuits</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                All calculators and information on OhmLab are provided for educational purposes only.
                We strive for accuracy in all our calculations and explanations, helping students verify
                their homework, understand concepts, and learn by doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We keep explanations practical and student-friendly so the theory behind resistance becomes
                easier to apply in real circuits and classroom problems.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
                We focus on three key principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Every calculator uses correct formulas and provides reliable results</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Clean, easy-to-use interfaces that don't overwhelm</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Clear explanations that help you understand the concepts, not just get answers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
            <p>
                OhmLab is designed for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High school physics students learning about electricity</li>
                <li>College students studying electrical engineering</li>
                <li>Electronics hobbyists and makers</li>
                <li>Teachers looking for reliable tools for demonstrations</li>
                <li>Anyone curious about how electronic components work</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>About the Creator</h2>
            <p>
                OhmLab is created and maintained by <strong>Ajmal Ali A</strong>, based in Kerala, India.
                As an individual passionate about education and technology, the goal is to provide
                quality learning resources that make physics and electronics more accessible to students everywhere.
            </p>

            <h2>Free and Accessible</h2>
            <p>
                All calculators on OhmLab are completely free to use. There are no accounts required,
                no paywalls, and no hidden fees. Our commitment is to keep these tools accessible to
                all students, regardless of their location or resources.
            </p>

            <h2>Goals and Future Roadmap</h2>
            <p>
                OhmLab is evolving into a broader electronics learning platform with clear goals for the
                future. We plan to expand content for current, power, and LED resistor sizing, add clearer
                step-by-step explanations, and provide quick-reference guides for classroom and lab use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Long-term, the project aims to include interactive circuit examples, printable study notes,
                and a glossary of electronics terms so students can connect formulas to real-world builds.
            </p>

            <h2>History of Resistors</h2>
            <p>
                Resistors have been part of electronics since the earliest telegraph and radio circuits, when
                engineers needed a reliable way to control current and protect delicate components. Early
                resistors were often made from carbon compounds or wire-wound coils, and their values were
                marked by hand. Over time, manufacturing improved to include metal film and precision
                resistors with tighter tolerances. Fun fact: the “ohm” unit is named after Georg Ohm, whose
                1827 work linked voltage, current, and resistance into the law we still use today. Modern
                resistors are tiny, cheap, and found in everything from smartphones to spacecraft, yet the
                simple idea remains the same—resistors turn excess electrical energy into heat so circuits
                stay stable and predictable.
            </p>

            <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
            <p>
                We're committed to maintaining and improving OhmLab. If you have suggestions, find errors,
                or would like to see additional features, please don't hesitate to reach out through our
                <a href="contact.html" style="color: var(--primary-color);">contact page</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Accuracy Commitment</h2>
            <p>
                While we make every effort to ensure all calculations are accurate and reliable, we always
                recommend verifying critical calculations, especially for projects involving safety or
                expensive components. See our <a href="disclaimer.html" style="color: var(--primary-color);">disclaimer</a>
