            <h2>Resistor History & Fun Facts</h2>
            <p>
                The word “resistor” became common as electronics matured, but the idea of restricting current
                goes back to early electrical experiments. Fun fact: many classic radios used large, colorless
                resistors marked with printed values, and technicians relied on lookup charts to decode them.
                Today’s color bands made the process faster and reduced errors. Understanding those roots
                reminds us why precise resistance values remain critical in safe circuit design.
            </p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
